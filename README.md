# Blog-Post-MVC

## Description

This application allows the user to post blogs on a website deployed with Heroku. The user will be able to sign up, and log in to begin posting blogs. The user will also be able to update and delete blogs that they have already written. The user will be able to view their blog posts on their dashboard, which can only be accessed by logging in. 

## Installation

The user will not have to install anything to use our application.

## Usage

To use this repository, the user will need to run "npm i" in the directory of the cloned repository. The user will have to create the database in MySQL and provide the necessary authentication in a .env file. Then, the user will have to run "npm start" to start the server.
